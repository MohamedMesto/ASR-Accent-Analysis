# Analyzing Confounding Effect of Accents in E-2-E ASR models

This reposiotry contains code for our paper ***How Accents Confound: Probing for Accent Information in End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems***, on understanding the confounding effect of accents in an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model: [DeepSpeech 2](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch) through several probing/analysis techniques, which is going to appear in [ACL 2020](acl2020.org).
