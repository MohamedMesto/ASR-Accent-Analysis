## Confusion Matrics
After training the phone-classifies on frame-level representations we look at the confusion matrices present in folder `ConfusionMatrices` and are generated using `Confusion Matrix.ipynb`. We observe that the accuracy trends are reflected in the confusion matrices as well. The confusion in the phones also appears to be *phonetically sound* and shows different patterns for different accents.
